## Overview
Minesweeper - is a single-player game where the objective is to reveal all the “safe squares”. In Minesweeper, there are randomly placed bombs throughout the board and the bombs clicking on squares will reveal the number of bombs in its 8-block vicinity. You can place down flags to mark where you believe there is a bomb to make the best choice for which block to explore next. Exploring a safe block will reveal the number of bombs within its vicinity. However, exploring a bomb block will cause an explosion and end the game.
